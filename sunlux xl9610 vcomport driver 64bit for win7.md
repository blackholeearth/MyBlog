**sunlux xl9610 barcode scanner, vcom-port (vcp) driver 64bit for win7**

when u scan vcp mode user-manual, it automatically installs driver to windows 10.
but it didnt auto-install for my windows 7 work pc.!!

to solve this:
i extracted auto-installed driver from my win10 pc.
and installed it into unknown-device  on win7 pc.

## step to extract driver
1) open  device manager .
2) menu > view > [check] show hidden devices

6) right-click > properties  (new window opens)> event tab
7)  check the list. learn the inf file name
